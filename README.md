Multi/Singleplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game.

- If you have docker on you desktop, navigate to root of the project, open console and type: docker-compose up --build.
This should run the project at http://localhost:3000.

- If you don't have docker, you will need to install all dependencies you can see in package.json files, and if you manage to do it correctly,
navigate do /be and type node index.ts. This command will run server.
After you did this, navigate to /fe folder and type npm start. This command will start frontend side of application.

For better experience, don't open 2 tabs frontend application on the same browser, you should either go to incognito on the second one, or open it from differenct browser,
although it will work either way.
